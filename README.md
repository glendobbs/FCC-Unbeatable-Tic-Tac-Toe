# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe
###### This was another project as part of the FreeCodeCamp front-end curriculum.
##### The brief was as follows:
- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
###### I also created an unbeatable AI using a variation of the MiniMax algorithm.
